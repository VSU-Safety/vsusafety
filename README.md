Safety app
walking app
hanging out app
Best idea is safety app for the campus 
to provide people with more comfort on being on this campus
Mobile
Uniquely Mobile Features:
Use GPS and location services to show real-time positioning on campus maps, highlighting nearby emergency stations, well-lit pathways, and safe zones.
Push notifications to alert users of incidents or unsafe areas in real-time.
Camera integration for quick incident reporting (e.g., send photos of hazards or safety concerns).
Utilize sensors to detect phone motion (e.g., alert users who are stationary in unsafe zones too long).
Story
Compelling Narrative:
Directly addresses concerns about campus safety, a high-priority issue for students and parents.
Clearly communicates the value of knowing where to go, how to stay safe, and how to get help quickly.
A product that promotes peace of mind, fostering trust among students, faculty, and their families.
Peer Response:
Students and staff would likely respond positively, as it provides convenience and protection in everyday scenarios.
Market
Market Size:
Every college or university campus represents a potential market. With over 19 million students in the U.S. alone, there’s a large user base.
Can also expand to corporate campuses, large parks, or event spaces.
Niche Value:
Ideal for those on large or urban campuses, where navigating safely is often a challenge.
Appeals to a tech-savvy, safety-conscious demographic.
Habit
Usage Frequency:
Students would use it daily to navigate well-lit pathways, find buildings, and stay informed about incidents.
The app can incorporate habitual checks: a "Safe Walk" feature that confirms users reach their destination or provides real-time guidance.
Encourages both consumption (alerts, maps) and creation (reporting issues, sharing routes).
Scope
Technical Feasibility:
A stripped-down MVP could include interactive maps, push notifications, and emergency contact features.
Features like live incident reports, crowd-sourced data (e.g., “I don’t feel safe here”), and AI for route suggestions can be added later.
Defined Goals:
Focus on simplicity and reliability: an app that users can depend on in critical moments.
Core product elements (safety alerts, navigation, emergency contacts) are clear and achievable within the program’s timeframe.
My final idea: Create an app which shows buildings on campus and shows emergency contancts and overal keep the well being of students safer
